# Machine Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng - Coursera
Python-code materials for the Machine Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng (Coursera). 

This specialization consists on 3 course:
1. Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification
2. Advanced Learning Algorithms
3. Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning

I put the materials here for references in the future.
